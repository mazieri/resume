### [About me](#shortcuts)

I started with Delphi, went through C, Lua, Java, Python, Swift and finally stopped at Dart/Flutter.

I'm curious, I love to read, and I'm a fast learner. 

I usually study on my own in my spare time, looking to improve my knowledge and learn new technologies.
I also study unrelated things, because I believe that all knowledge is welcome. Furthermore, I can teach and help people, even if they aren't in my area of expertise.
